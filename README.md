A collection of Docker images used for isolating the build environment for various project. Especially those projects using ROS or other large runtime systems, this allows for modularity and easy deployment to new systems and for porting existing code between machines. This repo also contains a launcher script that access the host machine's graphics hardware to allow for GUI drawing and acceleration.
